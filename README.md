# data_retrieve

#This .ipynb notebook is separated into five working parts, one for each school that is complete: HBS, Wharton, Stanford, Haas, and University of Michigan Ross. 
Two other schools are partially complete. I have not included these here. 

#Data is saved into dataframes, then concatenated and loaded into MongoDB. The output is the MongoDB collection with courses and descriptions. 
Some descriptions are arrays themselves, with one further level in the hierarchy.


#Thanks again.
